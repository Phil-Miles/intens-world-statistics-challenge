Hello :)

There was a small discrepancy I had noticed when reading the task description.
The "Word Count Overall" target value was first described as a number of occurences for a word in the **entire "Description" column.**
Later, in the result table column description, it was named "Total Count" and described as the number of occurences **per "Description" (per field).**
Seeing how the last description (the one that itemizes and describes the result table values 1-13) seems more detailed, I decided to go with that description.
